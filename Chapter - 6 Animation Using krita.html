    <h1>Animation in Krita - Questions & Answers</h1>

    <h2>Q1. How do you switch to the animation workspace in Krita?</h2>
    <p>To switch to the <strong>animation workspace</strong> in Krita, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Go to the "Window" menu</strong> located at the top of the interface.</li>
        <li>From the dropdown, select <strong>"Workspace"</strong>, and then choose <strong>"Animation"</strong> from the list of available workspaces.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This will switch the layout to the animation-specific workspace, where you'll have access to animation tools like the timeline, playback controls, and other features designed for creating and editing animations.</p>

    <h2>Q2. Differentiate between a frame and a keyframe.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Frame</strong>: A single image in the animation sequence.</li>
        <li><strong>Keyframe</strong>: A significant frame that defines major points in the animation (start/end positions).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Q3. What is the significance of the timeline in Krita?</h2>
    <p>The <strong>timeline</strong> in Krita is significant because it organizes and controls the sequence of frames and keyframes. It allows you to manage the timing of your animation, adjust when each frame appears, and edit the overall flow of the animation. It is an essential tool for previewing, modifying, and fine-tuning the animation.</p>

    <h2>Q4. What are layers used for?</h2>
    <p><strong>Layers</strong> in Krita are used to organize different elements of an artwork or animation. They allow you to separate various parts of the drawing or animation (such as backgrounds, characters, effects, etc.) so you can work on them independently without affecting other elements. In animation, layers help you control visibility, timing, and movement of different objects.</p>

    <h2>Q5. Write down the steps to rename a layer.</h2>
    <p>To rename a layer in Krita, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Right-click</strong> on the layer you want to rename in the <strong>Layers docker</strong> (the layer panel).</li>
        <li>Select <strong>"Rename"</strong> from the context menu.</li>
        <li>Type the new name for the layer and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Alternatively, you can double-click the layer name in the Layers panel to rename it directly.</p>
