                    <h3 style="color: green;">1. Integumentary System</h3>
                    <p>The integumentary system includes the skin, hair, nails, and glands. It serves as the body’s outer protection, regulates temperature, and enables sensation. The skin helps prevent dehydration and protects internal organs from external harm.</p>

                    <h3 style="color: green;">2. Skeletal System</h3>
                    <p>The skeletal system provides structural support to the body, protects internal organs, stores minerals, and produces blood cells in the bone marrow. It consists of 206 bones and several ligaments that provide movement and flexibility.</p>

                    <h3 style="color: green;">3. Muscular System</h3>
                    <p>The muscular system enables movement by contracting and relaxing. There are three types of muscles: skeletal muscles (voluntary control), smooth muscles (involuntary), and cardiac muscles (heart). This system works in coordination with the skeletal system to facilitate movement.</p>

                    <h3 style="color: green;">4. Nervous System</h3>
                    <p>The nervous system controls body activities through electrical signals transmitted by neurons. It includes the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. The nervous system helps in processing sensory input, decision making, and coordinating movements.</p>

                    <h3 style="color: green;">5. Cardiovascular System</h3>
                    <p>The cardiovascular system circulates blood, supplying oxygen and nutrients while removing carbon dioxide and waste. It consists of the heart and blood vessels (arteries, veins, and capillaries). The heart pumps blood through the circulatory system, ensuring efficient nutrient transport.</p>

                    <h3 style="color: green;">6. Lymphatic System</h3>
                    <p>The lymphatic system helps protect and maintain fluid balance in the body. It filters out pathogens and houses lymph nodes, spleen, and tonsils that support immune function. It also plays a role in absorbing fatty acids and fats from the digestive system.</p>

                    <h3 style="color: green;">7. Respiratory System</h3>
                    <p>The respiratory system facilitates gas exchange in the lungs. It absorbs oxygen from the air and expels carbon dioxide from the blood. It includes the nose, trachea, bronchi, lungs, and diaphragm, all working together to ensure the body’s tissues are oxygenated.</p>

                    <h3 style="color: green;">8. Digestive System</h3>
                    <p>The digestive system breaks down food into smaller molecules that can be absorbed into the bloodstream. The process includes ingestion, digestion, absorption, and excretion. It consists of the mouth, stomach, intestines, liver, pancreas, and gallbladder.</p>

                    <h3 style="color: green;">9. Urinary System</h3>
                    <p>The urinary system filters waste from the blood, maintains fluid and electrolyte balance, and expels urine. It consists of the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. The kidneys filter blood to remove waste, while the bladder stores and expels urine.</p>

                    <h3 style="color: green;">10. Endocrine System</h3>
                    <p>The endocrine system regulates bodily functions using hormones. It includes glands like the thyroid, pituitary, adrenal glands, and pancreas. These hormones regulate metabolism, growth, reproduction, and mood.</p>

                    <h3 style="color: green;">11. Reproductive System</h3>
                    <p>The reproductive system produces offspring through the formation of sperm and eggs. It includes the male (testes, prostate, penis) and female (ovaries, uterus, vagina) reproductive organs. Hormones regulate this system during puberty and reproduction.</p>

                    <h3 style="color: purple;">Key Organs and Their Functions</h3>
                    <p><b style="color: green;">Brain:</b> The brain controls thoughts, memory, emotion, touch, motor skills, vision, breathing, temperature, and many more. It is the command center of the body.</p>

                    <p><b style="color: green;">Gallbladder:</b> The gallbladder stores bile produced by the liver, releasing it to aid in the digestion of fats.</p>
                    <p><b style="color: green;">Pancreas:</b> The pancreas produces insulin and other enzymes that regulate blood sugar and aid in digestion.</p>
                    <p><b style="color: green;">Stomach:</b> The stomach digests food by mixing it with digestive juices, breaking it down into nutrients.</p>
                    <p><b style="color: green;">Bones:</b> Bones provide structural support and protection for vital organs, facilitate movement by serving as levers for muscles, and store essential minerals such as calcium and phosphorus. Bone marrow produces blood cells, crucial for oxygen transport and immune function.</p>

                    <h3 style="color: purple;">Muscles</h3>
                    <p>Muscles enable movement by contracting and relaxing in response to signals from the nervous system. They also help maintain posture and generate body heat. The human body has three types of muscles: skeletal, smooth, and cardiac.</p>
